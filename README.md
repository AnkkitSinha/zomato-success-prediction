# Zomato Restaurant Success Prediction

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the success of Zomato restaurants based on various features like location, cuisine, cost, and ratings. The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to a restaurant's success and predict future performance of new restaurants.

## Features and Target
The dataset includes the following features:
- Location
- Cuisine type
- Approximate cost for two people
- User ratings

The target variable is a binary value where 1 indicates success and 0 indicates failure.

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory data analysis with visualizations.
3. Feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
4. Building a RandomForest model to predict success.
5. Evaluating the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Results
The RandomForest model achieved an accuracy of 91%, with the details of precision, recall, and F1-score elaborated in the notebook.
